CoreELEC_19.3_ambilight_ok.tar.bz2 contains the
latest ambilight patches back-transferred to CE 19.3. This is the last version
which can do HDR to SDR (my TV does not support HDR). Use it as follows:

bzip2 -d CoreElec_19.3_ambilight_ok.tar.bz2
cp CoreElec_19.3_ambilight_ok.tar /storage/.update

IMPORTANT HINT: This does not work for Radxa Zero 2 as this version has been
supported starting with CE 19.5. However, it works perfectly for Radxa Zero and Odroid N2(+).
